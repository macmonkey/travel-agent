Martin Isau-Frank and his partner are planning a 4-day trip in January 2026 from Bangkok to Angkor Wat.  They are interested in culture, nature, local interactions, and culinary experiences. They prefer comfortable accommodation. The exact duration to be spent in Bangkok vs. Siem Reap is unclear, as is the budget (stated as 0â‚¬, likely a placeholder).  Clarification on these points is essential.
